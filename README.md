The project is very simple and aims to expand images, cards on click. 
Every 'div' in Html containes two classes : 'img' and 'active' and of course class of 'wrapper' 

'body' and 'wrapper' are in flex

If dislpay is under 480px , 4th and 5th images are at display none
due to screen width on small devices.
